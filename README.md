# swiper
swiper - an application for selecting new songs based on those already liked on Spotify.

## project goal and description:

### goals:
- develop an analogue of the Swipify application.
- improving the algorithm for selecting new songs by implementing neural networks.
- add feature to add directly to "Liked Songs" playlist.
- later there will be more...

### short description
The basis of the idea of ​​developing this application is to learn how to work with neural networks, reverse engineering an existing application with improvements "for yourself". It is also planned to adapt this project for Android.

The concept of swiper is to quickly select non-trivial options for new songs that the user may like. The process between the first listening to a sample of a song and adding it to the selected playlist should be as simple as possible, in a couple of clicks. Simple design and ease of use are a priority.
